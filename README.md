# Prediction-of-rainfall-in-the-UK-using-machine-learning-techniques
This is my MSc dissertation at University of Essex, UK.
In this dissertation project I have used python, machine learning, deep learning, measuring techniques of how well the models have been performed.
Workflow:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Feature engineering
3. Data visualization
4. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
5. Data preparing for the machine learning and deep learning models
6. Model fitting
7. Implementing measuring techniques
8. Comparing among the various machine learning and deep learning models
9. Selecting the best models
